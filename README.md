# Notation Map
[picaq](https://github.com/picaq) / [notation-map](https://github.com/picaq/notation-map)
- Uses React and [vexflow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) to generate [Scientific pitch notation (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation) 
- View it here: [Notation Map](https://picaq.github.io/notation-map/)
- Lower case `b` for flats, and `#` for sharps
- Accidental symbol buttons can also modify the input
- `r` key or the `random` button will randomize notes
- `esc` key deletes and focuses on input field

## Todo
- [x] index diatonic notes to an array
  - [ ] allows arrow keys to move through staff
  - [x] additional arrays for different key signatures? maybe?
- [x] flats and sharps as floats? (or different array)
- [ ] set note ranges for instruments
  - [ ] highlight top and bottom notes at the edge of range 
- [ ] link to physical instruments: image map? svg? buttons?
- [ ] For fun: pitch standard slider and frequency calculation
