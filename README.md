## Todo
- [ ] index diatonic notes to an array
  - [ ] allows arrow keys to move through staff
  - [ ] additional arrays for different key signatures? maybe?
- [ ] flats and sharps as floats? (or different array)
- [ ] set note ranges for instruments
  - [ ] highlight top and bottom notes at the edge of range 
- [ ] link to physical instruments: image map? svg? buttons?
