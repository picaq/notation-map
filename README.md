- Uses React and [vexflow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) to generate [Scientific pitch notation (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation)

## Todo
- [x] index diatonic notes to an array
  - [ ] allows arrow keys to move through staff
  - [x] additional arrays for different key signatures? maybe?
- [x] flats and sharps as floats? (or different array)
- [ ] set note ranges for instruments
  - [ ] highlight top and bottom notes at the edge of range 
- [ ] link to physical instruments: image map? svg? buttons?
- [ ] For fun: pitch standard slider and frequency calculation
